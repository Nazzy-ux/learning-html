            <b>"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the<br>
             charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue;<br>
             and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain.<br>
             These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being <br>
             able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or<br>
             the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in<br>
             these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."</b>

             denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer<br>
             of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not<br>
             know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain<br>
             of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which<br>
             of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure<br>
             that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"
